## Smart-Thinking

Smart-Thinking is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that delivers graph-based, multi-step reasoning without relying on external AI APIs. Everything happens locally: similarity search, heuristic-based scoring, verification tracking, memory, and visualization all run in a deterministic pipeline designed for transparency and reproducibility.

## Core Capabilities

- Graph-first reasoning that connects thoughts with rich relationships (supports, contradicts, refines, contextual links, and more).
- Local TF-IDF + cosine similarity engine powering memory lookups and graph expansion without third-party embedding services.
- Heuristic quality evaluation that scores confidence, relevance, and quality using transparent rules instead of LLM calls.
- Verification workflow with detailed statuses and calculation tracing to surface facts, guardrails, and uncertainties.
- Persistent sessions that can be resumed across runs, keeping both the reasoning graph and verification ledger in sync.

## Reasoning Flow

1. **Session bootstrap** – `ReasoningOrchestrator` initializes a session, restores any saved graph state, and prepares feature flags.
2. **Pre-verification** – deterministic guards inspect the incoming thought, perform light-weight calculation checks, and annotate the payload.
3. **Graph integration** – the thought is inserted into `ThoughtGraph`, linking to context, prior thoughts, and relevant memories.
4. **Heuristic evaluation** – `QualityEvaluator` and `MetricsCalculator` compute weighted scores and traces that explain the decision path.
5. **Verification feedback** – statuses from `VerificationService` and heuristic traces are attached to the node and propagated across connections.
6. **Persistence & response** – updates are written to `MemoryManager` / `VerificationMemory`, and a structured MCP response is returned with a timeline of reasoning steps.

Each step is logged with structured metadata so you can visualize the reasoning fabric, audit decisions, and replay sessions deterministically.

## Installation

Smart-Thinking ships as an npm package compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Global install (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g smart-thinking-mcp
```

### Run with npx

```bash
npx -y smart-thinking-mcp
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leghis/Smart-Thinking.git
cd Smart-Thinking
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

> Need platform-specific configuration details? See `GUIDE_INSTALLATION.md` for step-by-step instructions covering Windows, macOS, Linux, and Claude Desktop integration.

## Quick Tour

- `smart-thinking-mcp` — start the MCP server (globally installed package).
- `npx -y smart-thinking-mcp` — launch without a global install.
- `npm run start` — execute the built server from source.
- `npm run demo:session` — run the built-in CLI walkthrough that feeds sample thoughts through the reasoning pipeline and prints the resulting timeline.

The demo script showcases how the orchestrator adds nodes, evaluates heuristics, and records verification feedback step by step.

## MCP Client Compatibility

Smart-Thinking is validated across the most popular MCP clients and operating systems. Use the new connector mode (`--mode=connector` or `SMART_THINKING_MODE=connector`) when a client only accepts the `search` and `fetch` tools required by ChatGPT connectors.[^1]

| Client | Transport | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ChatGPT Connectors & Deep Research** | HTTP + SSE | Deploy with `SMART_THINKING_MODE=connector node build/index.js --transport=http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`. Point ChatGPT to `https://<host>/sse` and keep only `search` / `fetch` enabled, aligning with OpenAI’s remote MCP guidance.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-openai-mcp">1</a></sup> |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI & Agents SDK** | Streamable HTTP / SSE | Configure the Codex agent with `http://localhost:3000/mcp` or `http://localhost:3000/sse` and set `SMART_THINKING_MODE=connector` when only knowledge retrieval is needed.[^2] |
| **Claude Desktop / Claude Code** | stdio | Add `"command": "smart-thinking-mcp"` (or an `npx` command) to `claude_desktop_config.json`. Full toolset is available.[^3] |
| **Cursor IDE** | stdio / SSE / Streamable HTTP | Add the server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or the project `.cursor/mcp.json`. Cursor supports prompts, roots, elicitation, and streaming.[^4] |
| **Cline (VS Code)** | stdio | Place the command in `~/Documents/Cline/MCP/smart-thinking.json` or use the in-app marketplace to register the toolset.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-mcp-clients">3</a></sup> |
| **Kilo Code** | stdio | Register via the MCP marketplace and run the server locally; Smart-Thinking exposes deterministic tooling for autonomous edits.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-mcp-clients">3</a></sup> |

> Need a minimal deployment footprint? Combine `--transport=http --mode=connector` with a reverse proxy (ngrok, fly.io, render, etc.) so remote clients can consume the server without exposing the full toolset.

For registry scanners and fallback metadata extraction, Smart-Thinking also exposes:

- `GET /.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`

## Configuration & Feature Flags

- `feature-flags.ts` toggles advanced behaviours such as external integrations (disabled by default) and verbose tracing.
- `config.ts` aligns platform-specific paths and verification thresholds.
- `memory-manager.ts` and `verification-memory.ts` store session graphs, metrics, and calculation results using deterministic JSON snapshots.

## Zero-API-Key Mode (Default)

- Smart-Thinking runs fully in local deterministic mode without any API key.
- External verification/search connectors are disabled by default in `ToolIntegrator`.
- To explicitly enable external connectors, set:
```bash
export SMART_THINKING_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_TOOLS=true
```
- If external connectors are disabled (default), verification suggestions stay local (`executePython`, `executeJavaScript`) and external tool calls return a local fallback result.
- `FeatureFlags.externalLlmEnabled` and `FeatureFlags.externalEmbeddingEnabled` remain disabled by default, so no remote LLM/embedding provider is required.

## Development Workflow

```bash
npm run build           # Compile TypeScript sources
npm run lint            # ESLint across src/
npm run test            # Jest test suite
npm run test:coverage   # Jest coverage report
npm run watch           # Incremental TypeScript compilation
```

See `docs/modernisation-smart-thinking-v12-plan.md` for the modernization checklist and rollout tracking.

## Quality & Support

- Deterministic heuristics and verification eliminate dependency on remote LLMs.
- Latest validation (February 6, 2026): `80.47%` statements, `81.59%` lines, `84.34%` functions, `63.48%` branches.
- CI recommendations: run `npm run lint` and `npm run test:coverage` before each release candidate.
